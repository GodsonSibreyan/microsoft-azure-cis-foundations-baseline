  desc  "Resource Manager Locks provide a way for administrators to lock down
Azure resources to prevent deletion of, or modifications to, a resource. These
locks sit outside of the Role Based Access Controls (RBAC) hierarchy and, when
applied, will place restrictions on the resource for all users. These are very
useful when there is have an important resource in a subscription that users
should not be able to delete or change and can help prevent accidental and
malicious changes or deletion."
  desc  "rationale", "
    As an administrator, it may be necessary to lock a subscription, resource
group, or resource to prevent other users in the organization from accidentally
deleting or modifying critical resources. The lock level can be set to to
`CanNotDelete` or `ReadOnly` to achieve this purpose.

    - `CanNotDelete` means authorized users can still read and modify a
resource, but they can't delete the resource.

    - `ReadOnly` means authorized users can read a resource, but they can't
delete or update the resource. Applying this lock is similar to restricting all
authorized users to the permissions granted by the Reader role.

    1. Navigate to the specific Azure Resource or Resource Group
    2. For each of the mission critical resource, click on `Locks`
    3. Click `Add`
    4. Give the lock a name and a description, then select the type,
`CanNotDelete` or `ReadOnly` as appropriate

    **Azure Command Line Interface 2.0**

    To lock a resource, provide the name of the resource, its resource type,
and its resource group name.

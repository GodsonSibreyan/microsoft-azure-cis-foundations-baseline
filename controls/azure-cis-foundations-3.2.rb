    **Azure Console**

    1. Go to `Storage Accounts`
    2. For each storage account, go to `Activity log`
    3. Under `Timespan` drop-down, select `Custom` and choose `Start time` and
`End time` such that it ranges 90 days
    4. Enter `RegenerateKey` in the `Search` text box
    5. Click `Apply`

    It should list out all `RegenerateKey` events. If no such event exists,
then this is a finding.

    **Azure Command Line Interface 2.0**

    **Step 1 - Get a list of storage accounts**

    ```
    az storage account list
    ```

    Make a note of `id`, `name` and `resourceGroup`.

    **Step 2**
    For every storage account make sure that key is regenerated in past 90 days.

    ```
    az monitor activity-log list --resource-group
    ```

    The output should contain

    ```
    \"authorization\"/\"scope\":  AND \"authorization\"/\"action\":
\"Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/regenerateKey/action\" AND
\"status\"/\"localizedValue\": \"Succeeded\" \"status\"/\"Value\":
\"Succeeded\" AND \"eventTimestamp\" : (Should return time and date should be
less than past 90 days)
    ```

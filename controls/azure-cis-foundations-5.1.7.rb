    **Azure Command Line Interface 2.0**

    List all key vaults

    ```
    az keyvault list
    ```

    For each keyvault `id`
    ```
    az monitor diagnostic-settings list --resource
    ```

    Ensure that `storageAccountId` is set as appropriate. Also, ensure that
`category` and `days` are set. One of the sample outputs is as below.

    ```

     {
     \"category\": \"AuditEvent\",
     \"enabled\": true,
     \"retentionPolicy\": {
     \"days\": 180,
     \"enabled\": true
     }
     }

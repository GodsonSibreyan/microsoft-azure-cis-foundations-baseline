    Azure Active Directory authentication is a mechanism to connect to
Microsoft Azure SQL Database and SQL Data Warehouse by using identities in
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). With Azure AD authentication, identities of
database users and other Microsoft services can be managed in one central
location. Central ID management provides a single place to manage database
users and simplifies permission management.

    - It provides an alternative to SQL Server authentication.
    - Helps stop the proliferation of user identities across database servers.
    - Allows password rotation in a single place.
    - Customers can manage database permissions using external (AAD) groups.
    - It can eliminate storing passwords by enabling integrated Windows
authentication and other forms of authentication supported by Azure Active
Directory.
    - Azure AD authentication uses contained database users to authenticate
identities at the database level.
    - Azure AD supports token-based authentication for applications connecting
to SQL Database.
    - Azure AD authentication supports ADFS (domain federation) or native
user/password authentication for a local Azure Active Directory without domain
synchronization.
    - Azure AD supports connections from SQL Server Management Studio that use
Active Directory Universal Authentication, which includes Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA). MFA includes strong authentication with a range of easy
verification options: phone call, text message, smart cards with pin, or mobile
app notification.

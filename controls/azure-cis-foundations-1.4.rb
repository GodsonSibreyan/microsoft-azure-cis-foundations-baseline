    Remembering Multi-Factor Authentication(MFA) for devices and browsers
allows users to have the option to by-pass MFA for a set number of days after
performing a successful sign-in using MFA. This can enhance usability by
minimizing the number of times a user may need to perform two-step verification
on the same device.
    However, if an account or device is compromised, remembering MFA for
trusted devices may affect security. Hence, it is recommended that users not be
allowed to bypass MFA.

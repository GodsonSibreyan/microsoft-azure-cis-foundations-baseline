  desc  "Shared access signature tokens should be allowed only over HTTPS
protocol."
  desc  "rationale", "A shared access signature (SAS) is a URI that grants
restricted access rights to Azure Storage resources. A shared access signature
can be provided to clients who should not be trusted with the storage account
key but for whom it may be necessary to delegate access to certain storage
account resources. Providing a shared access signature URI to these clients
allows them access to a resource for a specified period of time. It is
recommended to allow such access requests over HTTPS protocol only."
  desc  "check", "Currently, SAS token protocols cannot be audited. Until
Microsoft makes SAS transfer protocols a setting rather than a token creation
parameter, this recommendation will require a manual verification."
  desc  "fix", "

    1. Go to `Storage Accounts`
    2. For each storage account, go to `Shared access signature`
    3. Set `Allowed protocols` to `HTTPS only`

    *Please note that at this point of time, there is no API/CLI mechanism
available to programmatically conduct security assessment for this
recommendation.*

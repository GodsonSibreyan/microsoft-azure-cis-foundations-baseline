  desc  "Restricting default network access helps to provide a new layer of
security, since storage accounts accept connections from clients on any
network. To limit access to selected networks, the default action must be
changed."
  desc  "rationale", "Storage accounts should be configured to deny access to
traffic from all networks (including internet traffic). Access can be granted
to traffic from specific Azure Virtual networks, allowing a secure network
boundary for specific applications to be built. Access can also be granted to
public internet IP address ranges, to enable connections from specific internet
or on-premises clients. When network rules are configured, only applications
from allowed networks can access a storage account. When calling from an
allowed network, applications continue to require proper authorization (a valid
access key or SAS token) to access the storage account."

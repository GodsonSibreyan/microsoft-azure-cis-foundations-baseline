  desc  "Expire shared access signature tokens within an hour."
  desc  "rationale", "A shared access signature (SAS) is a URI that grants
restricted access rights to Azure Storage resources. A shared access signature
can be provided to clients who should not be trusted with the storage account
key but for whom it may be necessary to delegate access to certain storage
account resources. Providing a shared access signature URI to these clients
allows them access to a resource for a specified period of time. This time
should be set as low as possible and preferably no longer than an hour."
  desc  "check", "Currently, SAS token expiration times cannot be audited.
Until Microsoft makes token expiration time a setting rather than a token
creation parameter, this recommendation would require a manual verification."
  desc  "fix", "When generating shared access signature tokens, use start and
end time such that it falls within an hour."

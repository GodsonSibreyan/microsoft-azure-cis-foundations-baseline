    Windows and Linux virtual machines should be kept updated to:
    - Address a specific bug or flaw
    - Improve an OS or applicationâ€™s general stability
    - Fix a security vulnerability

    The Azure Security Center retrieves a list of available security and
critical updates from Windows Update or Windows Server Update Services (WSUS),
depending on which service is configured on a Windows VM. The security center
also checks for the latest updates in Linux systems. If a VM is missing a
system update, the security center will recommend system updates be applied.

    1. Go to `Security Center - Recommendations`
    2. Ensure that there are no recommendations for `Apply system updates`

    Alternatively, you can employ your own patch assessment and management tool
to periodically assess, report and install the required security patches for
your OS.

    *Please note that at this point of time, there is no API/CLI mechanism
available to programmatically conduct security assessment for this
recommendation.*
